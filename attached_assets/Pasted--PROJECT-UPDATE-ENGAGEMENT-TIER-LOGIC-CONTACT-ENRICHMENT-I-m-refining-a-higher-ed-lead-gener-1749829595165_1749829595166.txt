üìå PROJECT UPDATE: ENGAGEMENT TIER LOGIC + CONTACT ENRICHMENT

I‚Äôm refining a higher ed lead generation system. The current implementation uses hardcoded engagement tiers (e.g., ‚ÄúMulti-phase implementation (50K‚Äì200K)‚Äù) and confidence scores, but these aren't yet calculated based on clear logic.

### GOAL:
Refactor the system so that engagement tier and confidence logic are configurable (currently placeholder logic is fine for testing), and replace the "Suggested Action" section with a list of potential contacts.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

1. **Engagement Tier Logic**
   - Create a variable or dictionary called `ENGAGEMENT_TIER_RULES` at the top of `lead_generation_service.py`.
   - Store default logic such as:
     ```python
     ENGAGEMENT_TIER_RULES = {
         "Small": ["LMS update", "one-time website rebuild"],
         "Medium": ["ERP implementation", "AI governance", "cloud migration"],
         "Recurring": ["Institutional research modernization", "security audits", "CRM lifecycle tracking"],
         "Full Outsourcing": ["entire IT department management"],
     }
     ```
   - Add logic that inspects the opportunity summary and source content.
   - Match keywords from the above to assign a default tier.
   - Add a `# NOTE:` above this logic that says:
     ```python
     # NOTE: Dynamic Campus should define its own tier classification rules before going to production.
     ```

2. **Confidence Scoring Logic**
   - Create a variable called `DC_SERVICE_KEYWORDS = [...]`
   - Default contents might include:
     ```python
     DC_SERVICE_KEYWORDS = [
         "ERP", "AI governance", "cybersecurity", "data governance", "LMS", "CRM", "institutional research"
     ]
     ```
   - Confidence score should be based on overlap between these and the article content (e.g., cosine match or keyword hit count)
   - Add a `# NOTE:` above this logic:
     ```python
     # NOTE: These keywords represent Dynamic Campus services. This list must be reviewed and finalized before production use.
     ```

3. **Replace Suggested Action with Potential Contacts**
   - Remove or suppress the ‚ÄúSuggested Action‚Äù field in final email formatting.
   - Add a new section: **Potential Contacts**
   - Scrape or extract contact names and roles from the article sources if possible.
   - If no contacts are available in the sources:
     - Use web search, job boards, or tools like Clearbit/Hunter to locate likely roles (CIO, VP of IT, Provost, etc.)
   - Display 2‚Äì3 possible contacts with names, titles, and (if possible) links or email addresses.
   - If no contacts can be found, insert a fallback message:
     ```
     No direct contacts found. Recommend searching university leadership directory or executive board page.
     ```

4. **Update README.md**
   - Briefly describe how the engagement tier and confidence systems work.
   - Mention that the service keyword list and tier definitions are placeholders.

Once complete, I‚Äôll test the updated lead summaries and ensure they reflect DC‚Äôs priorities more accurately.
