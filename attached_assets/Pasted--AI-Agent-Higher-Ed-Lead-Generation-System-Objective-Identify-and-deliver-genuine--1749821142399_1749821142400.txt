## 🧠 How to Determine a Lead

A valid **lead** must meet the following criteria:

1. **Triangulated Context**: Minimum of 3 credible sources that reinforce or clarify each other.
   - One must be institution-specific.
   - Others may be sectoral, regional, or cultural, but **must connect back** to the institution in a meaningful way.

2. **Tech-Relevance**: Opportunity should involve:
   - ERP modernization
   - IT org changes
   - Cybersecurity issues or policy shifts
   - AI/data governance
   - LMS/CRM enhancements
   - Institutional research or analytics transformation

3. **Time Sensitivity**:
   - Appointments, public breaches, or sudden policy changes must be tagged as “Fresh Leads”

4. **Client Status**:
   - Exclude current Dynamic Campus clients
   - Don’t resubmit a past lead unless 6+ months have passed and context has changed

## 🛡️ System Constraints and Best Practices

- **No single-source leads** (e.g. a lone job posting)
- Validate RSS stability (check for 404s or connection timeouts)
- Randomize articles to avoid repetition
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive data (e.g. OpenAI keys)
- Implement fallback logic for GPT or feed failure
