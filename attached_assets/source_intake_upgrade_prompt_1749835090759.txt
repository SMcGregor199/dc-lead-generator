SYSTEM UPGRADE: INTELLIGENT SOURCE INTAKE & CROSS-REFERENCING

I’m refining my higher ed lead generation system (dc-lead-generator) to increase the quality, relevance, and reliability of the sources it pulls from — particularly for news articles, job postings, and cross-referenced opportunities.

OBJECTIVES:

1. Ensure news and job sources are always fresh, valid, and specific to institutional IT transformation efforts.
2. Eliminate stale or outdated data.
3. Improve lead confidence by intelligently cross-referencing multiple data points (articles + jobs).
4. Automate source validation and incorporate broader source types over time.

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

1. Automate Job Feed Refresh

- Replace or augment the static `higher_ed_jobs.json` file with an automated job scraper.
- Use one of the following sources for scraping:
  - Google Jobs Search API (search for roles like CIO, VP of IT, Chief Data Officer)
  - HigherEdJobs RSS (if working)
  - EDUCAUSE Career Center
- Target roles with titles that imply transformation needs (e.g., "data governance", "IT strategy", "CIO", etc.)
- Schedule this scraper to run daily or weekly and output to a structured JSON like:

{
  "title": "Chief Information Officer",
  "institution": "University of Vermont",
  "description": "...",
  "location": "Burlington, VT",
  "url": "..."
}

2. RSS Feed Health Monitoring

- Refactor `feed_tester.py` into an automated health checker script.
- Run this checker weekly and log results in a file (e.g., `rss_health_log.txt`).
- Flag feeds with:
  - Non-200 responses
  - Repeated empty results (no entries)
- Optionally email admin if feeds are broken for more than 2 consecutive runs.

3. Source Confidence Scoring System

- Assign confidence weights to each source type:
  - +0.9 = Institutional RFP or strategic plan
  - +0.8 = Press release from .edu domain
  - +0.7 = Full-length article from Higher Ed Dive, Inside Higher Ed
  - +0.4 = Job post without detail
  - +0.2 = Blog/opinion piece

- Add a confidence field to each lead using this logic, and factor it into lead ranking or filtering.
- Store this logic in a centralized dictionary or function so it can be adjusted later.

4. Multi-Source Institution Matching

- Add logic that detects when two or more sources (job + article) reference the same institution.
- If the institution name matches and the dates are within ~30 days, merge the insights into a single lead.
- This boosts confidence and gives a fuller picture of the opportunity.

5. Expand Source Types (for future implementation)

- Prepare a system to pull from additional trusted sources:
  - EDUCAUSE Library
  - Conference agendas (EDUCAUSE, Internet2, NACUBO)
  - Public university .edu press rooms
  - BidNet, public RFP sites
- Allow for `.edu` press room URLs to be stored in a config list and scraped weekly.

NOTES & TESTING

- Be sure all updated modules continue writing to `higher_ed_leads.json` and integrate with the fallback logic and confidence scoring.
- Annotate any new config blocks with comments like:

# NOTE: These weights are defaults and should be reviewed by Dynamic Campus before production use.

This prompt should be treated as a source resilience upgrade. It ensures our leads aren't just intelligent — they're comprehensive, fresh, and verified. Let me know when the upgrades are in place and I’ll help verify lead accuracy!
