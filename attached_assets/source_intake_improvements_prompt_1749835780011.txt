ðŸ”§ PROJECT UPGRADE INSTRUCTION â€” SOURCE INTAKE IMPROVEMENTS

You're maintaining and expanding the AI-powered Python project `dc-lead-generator`.

Please implement the following improvements to the source intake logic:

---

1. **Replace fragile Google job links**  
Google Jobs links currently used in the repo are session-based and unreliable. Replace them with more stable sources like:
- HigherEdJobs (https://www.higheredjobs.com/rss/)
- Chronicle Jobs
- LinkedIn Jobs API (optional)
- Existing Workday job feeds from MIT, UCSD, Duke, etc.

---

2. **Log broken or dead feeds**  
Add error-handling to both `news_service.py` and `rss_health_monitor.py`. If an RSS feed fails or returns no entries, log it to a `broken_sources.log` file for future auditing.

Suggested pattern:

```python
try:
    feed = feedparser.parse(url)
    if not feed.entries:
        log_broken_feed(url)
except Exception as e:
    log_broken_feed(url, str(e))
```

---

3. **Create a `sources_config.json` file**  
Store all source URLs in a JSON config with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Inside Higher Ed",
  "url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/rss.xml",
  "type": "news",
  "confidence": "high",
  "last_verified": "2025-06-12"
}
```

Update `rss_health_monitor.py`, `news_service.py`, and `feed_tester.py` to pull from this new config file.

---

4. **(Optional) Enhance article text scraping**  
Some RSS feeds only provide summaries. If possible, use tools like `newspaper3k`, `Readability`, or `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and extract the full article body from the feed's `link`.

---

The goal is to improve both reliability and quality of the sources feeding into the lead generator. Let me know if you need mock data or example JSON files.
