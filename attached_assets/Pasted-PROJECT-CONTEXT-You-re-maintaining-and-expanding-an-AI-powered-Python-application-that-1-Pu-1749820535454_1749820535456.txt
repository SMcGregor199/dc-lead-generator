PROJECT CONTEXT:  
You're maintaining and expanding an AI-powered Python application that:

1. Pulls higher education tech-related content from multiple sources.
2. Summarizes articles and job posts using GPT.
3. Cross-references content to generate actionable IT service leads.
4. Emails a summary to the user daily at 7AM.

YOUR TASK:  
Audit, clean up, and expand this application based on the following instructions:

STEP 1 – Feed Validation & Cleanup:  
- Test all URLs in the RSS_FEEDS array for reliability (404s, timeouts).
- Replace or remove non-working feeds.
- Make sure articles are randomly selected per run.

STEP 2 – Code Quality Review:  
- Remove unused or outdated files.
- Rename files for clarity.
- Secure all secrets (API keys, email credentials).
- Add fallback logic if feeds or GPT summarization fail.
- Minimize unnecessary API calls or inefficient loops.

STEP 3 – Expand Cross-Referencing Capabilities:  
- Add new source categories:
  - Official university press releases
  - Strategic planning documents (.edu)
  - Conference speaker lineups
  - Federal IT grant announcements
  - Broader tech media filtered by higher-ed + digital transformation keywords

STEP 4 – Integrate Lead Qualification Logic:  
Embed the following logic:

> Do not generate a lead from a single article or job posting. A valid lead must be supported by at least 3 distinct sources. At least one must mention a specific institution, and the others must provide supporting signals of a digital transformation, CIO hiring, ERP implementation, or IR/BI needs.

Each lead must:
- Include a summary (3–5 sentences)
- Mention how the company (Dynamic Campus) could help
- Cite all sources
- Be tagged by engagement tier (small, medium, recurring, full IT outsource)

FINAL OUTPUT:  
Prepare a functioning version of the application that:
- Fetches, validates, and summarizes content
- Applies the lead scoring rules above
- Sends an email to the user with qualified leads and all cited sources

BONUS: Suggest any additional refinements or tools to improve performance or reliability.
