## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Set up the required environment variables in Replit Secrets:

**Required Secrets:**
- `GMAIL_ADDRESS` - Your Gmail address
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` - Gmail App Password (not regular password)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for news summarization

### Step 2: Generate Gmail App Password

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You must use a Gmail App Password, not your regular Gmail password.

1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
3. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled
4. Under "2-Step Verification", click on "App passwords"
5. Select "Mail" and "Other" device
6. Enter "Replit Email Bot" as the device name
7. Copy the 16-character app password (format: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)
8. Use this app password in your Replit Secret

### Step 3: Usage

**Immediate Email (Testing):**
```bash
python email_automation.py --mode immediate
```

**Scheduled Service (Production):**
```bash
python email_automation.py --mode schedule
```

### Step 4: RSS Feed Testing

Validate all RSS feeds:
```bash
python feed_tester.py
```

## Verified RSS Feeds

The system uses these validated higher education news sources:
- Inside Higher Ed
- EdTech Magazine Higher Ed  
- Higher Ed Dive
- Faculty Focus
- The PIE News
- Ruffalo Noel Levitz Blog
- The Guardian Higher Education

## Usage Examples

**Test RSS Feeds:**
```bash
python feed_tester.py
```

**Send Test Email:**
```bash
python email_automation.py --mode immediate
```

**Run Scheduler Service:**
```bash
python email_automation.py --mode schedule
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Authentication Error**: Verify your Gmail App Password is correct
2. **Email Not Received**: Check spam folder, verify recipient address
3. **Service Stopped**: Restart the workflow or enable Replit Always On
4. **Time Zone Issues**: The script uses server time (UTC) - adjust schedule if needed

### Checking Logs:

Monitor the workflow console for:
- ‚úÖ Successful email sends
- ‚ùå Error messages
- ‚è∞ Status updates

## Security Notes

- Gmail credentials are stored securely in Replit Secrets
- App passwords are used instead of regular passwords for enhanced security
- No sensitive information is logged or displayed
